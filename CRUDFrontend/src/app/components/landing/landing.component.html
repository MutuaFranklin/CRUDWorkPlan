      <h2>What is CRUD?</h2>
      <p>CRUD is an acronym that comes from the world of computer programming and
         refers to the four functions that are considered necessary to implement a
         persistent storage application: create, read, update and delete.
         Persistent storage refers to any data storage device that retains power
         after the device is powered off, such as a hard disk or a solid-state drive.
        In contrast, random access memory and internal caching are two examples of
        volatile memory - they contain data that will be erased when they lose power.
